OPTIONS
	CONFIGURATION & INITIALIZATION
		--load-dir=<path>
			Set the load directory.  Defaults to ~/.config/episodey.

		--scan-cfg=<path>
			Scan config file path.  This will override the default scan.cfg loaded from the load-dir

		--websites=<path>
			Multiple allowed. Specify A website config file path.  This file will be used in addition to
			any other website config files loaded by --load-dir or other --websites options.

		--media-sets=<path>
			Multiple allowed. Specify A media set config file path.  This file will be used in addition to
			any other media set config files loaded by --load-dir or other --media-sets options.

		--profile=<value>
			Specify the profile to execute this instance of episodey as.  Defaults to the first profile created.
			if <value> is an integer it represents the profile id of the profile you want to run as.	
			if <value> is an email it represents the email address of the profile you want to run as.	

		--config=<path>
			Load episodey config file from <path>.  Defaults to ~/.config/episodey/episodey.yml
			Using --load-dir does NOT change the default config file path.

		--db=<path>
			Specify the database file path to use for this instance of episodey.  Defaults to 
			~/.config/episodey/db/episodey.db.  Using --load-dir does NOT change the default database path.

		--daemon
			Run episodey in the background on an interval specified by --scan-interval.  

		--scan-interval=<seconds>
			Used with --daemon to specify how often to rescan.  episodey will rescan at every <seconds> seconds
			with all options specified when episodey was started with the --daemon options.
			
		
	ACTIONS
		--scan
			Scan websites for new media.  Also creates notifications which may be sent with --notify.
			All new notifications are created for the currently running profile.

		--notify
			Send new media notifications. 

		--save
			Save any media-sets, media, websites, postings, and notifications to the database.  
			Saving information to the database allows for tracking of what media has already been found,
			as well as saving notifications to be sent at a later time.

		--create-profile
			Create a new profile.

		--list
			List media-set,media,website, and or notifications found/created by episodey.

	ACTION MODIFIERS
		--new
			Use with --list, --notify, & --save. Only list/save new objects.
			When used with --notify only new notifications will be sent/saved, notifications already in the db 
			will be ignored whether they have been sent or not.

		--types=<value>
			Used with --list & --save. Only list/save <value> types of objects.
			<value> is a comma delimited list of any of: [media,media-sets,websites,notifications,all].

		--include=<regex>
			Multiple allowed.  Used with --list.  Only list objects who's u_id matches <regex>.
			If --types is not specified or "media" is included in types then <regex> matches against
			media objects only.  Otherwise all --types specified are checked.

		--exclude=<regex>
			Multiple allowed.  Used with --list.  Do not list objects who's u_id matches <regex>
			If --types is not specified or "media" is included in types then <regex> matches against
			media objects only.  Otherwise all --types specified are checked.

		--search=<regex>
			Equivalent to: --list --types=all --include=<regex>.

	OTHER OPTIONS
		--help
			Display help information about episodey.

		--verbose
			Print out way too much stuff during execution.

	FILES
		~/.config/episodey/
			default load directory.  contains the files that make episodey go.

			here as well. options include:
				smtp: smtp email creds & options
				database: database adapter (currently only sqlite3) and default db path
				options:
					page_limit: the number of pages to scan per website url

	FURTHER DOCUMENTATION
		When using --load-dir to change the load directory be sure to create the file structure
		specified in the FILES section of this documentation to ensure correct initialization of episodey.

		Also specifying --load-dir will NOT modify the default db or the episodey.yml config file path.  
		If you need to specify the db or config file path use the --db & --config options respectively.
